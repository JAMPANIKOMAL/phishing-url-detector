# AI-Powered Phishing URL Detector

**Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023 Problem Statement**

This repository contains a solution for SIH 2023 problem statement SIH1454, provided by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO).

---

## Problem Title

**Develop an intelligent AI/ML system to detect phishing domains that mimic genuine websites.**

---

## Project Objective

Build a machine learning model to classify URLs as "legitimate" or "phishing". The model is trained on a diverse dataset, learning to spot malicious patterns by analyzing lexical and structural URL features.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized for clarity and reproducibility:

- **/data**: Raw URL dataset for training and testing.
- **/models**: Serialized machine learning models.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the workflow:
    - `01_data_sourcing_and_exploration.ipynb`: Data loading and exploratory analysis.
    - `02_feature_engineering_and_preprocessing.ipynb`: Feature extraction and preprocessing.
    - `03_model_development.ipynb`: Model training and evaluation.
    - `04_results_and_visualization.ipynb`: Performance visualization and analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
- **README.md**: Project overview.
